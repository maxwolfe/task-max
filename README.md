# task-max
Organizing ourselves effectively is one of the most challenging problems we
face, regardless of our occupation or background. **task-max** is a highly
customizable tree-based organizational system which links tasks by their
dependencies (or children in a tree). This project provides a basic outline for
the core functionalities of an organizational tool and allows for easy
customization through inheritable or otherwise modifyable classes sufficiently
isolated from the core functionality.
